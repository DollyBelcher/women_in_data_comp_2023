The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) is a federal block grant distributed (via formula) to states and local governments. Recipients use the grant funds to carry out housing, economic development, and public improvement efforts that serve low, and moderate-income communities. This dataset provides point location, and relevant information of CDBG activities that have taken place since 1996, and which HUD classifies using one of the following categories:

**Asset Acquisition** - activity related to acquisition, including disposition, clearance and demolition, and clean-up of contaminated Sites/brownfields.

**Economic Development** - activity related to economic development, including commercial or industrial rehab, commercial or industrial land acquisition, commercial or industrial construction, commercial or industrial infrastructure development, direct assistance to businesses, and micro-enterprise assistance.

**Housing** - activity related to housing, including multifamily rehab, housing services, code enforcement, operation and repair of foreclosed property and public housing modernization.

**Public Improvements** - activity related to public improvements, including senior centers, youth centers, parks, street improvements, water/sewer improvements, child care centers, fire stations, health centers, non-residential historic preservation, etc.

**Public Services** - activity related to public services, including senior services, legal services, youth services, employment training, health services, homebuyer counseling, food banks, etc.

**Other** - activity related to urban renewal completion, non-profit organization capacity building, and assistance to institutions of higher education.
